# All Genres

This project provides a static website that visualizes music genres as an interactive tree. The site now contains dozens of styles so you can explore how they relate. Selecting a node loads a Spotify playlist for that genre in the embedded player.

## Usage

Open `public/index.html` in a web browser. Select a genre node to load its playlist. The Spotify player appears below the tree.

## Development

Dependencies are managed with npm. To install D3 locally run:

```bash
npm install
```
